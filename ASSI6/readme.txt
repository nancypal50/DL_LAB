Task 1: AUTOENCODER IN KERAS
The simplest possible autoencoder,a single fully-connected neural layer as encoder and as decoder


Task 2: Application to image denoising:

Train the autoencoder to map noisy digits images to clean digits images. Here generating the synthetic noisy digits: by appling a gaussian noise matrix and clip the images between 0 and 1.
