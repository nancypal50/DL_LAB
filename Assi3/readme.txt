 Display sample input and output images (at least 10 images).
 Display the total images in the database, size of the image, no of classes in the

 Display the first convolution function kernel filter coefficient values
 Display the training accuracy / training error
 Display the testing accuracy

2. Write a program to implement the new CNN model. The model should contains following
things : (Note : use any grayscale dataset with the 10 classes)
